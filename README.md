# This Repository

In this repository you will find a CMake template that covers all common use cases of CMake. Just copy the repository, add your C++ code and you're ready to go. In addition, there is a detailed guide on how to use CMake and how to structure a project.

## Credit where Credit is due
This repository is mostly base on the [Ulitmate Guide to Modern CMake](https://rix0r.nl/blog/2015/08/13/cmake-guide/) (the blog is no longer maintained and therefore does not have a valid certificate) by Rico a presumably former Site Reliability Enginee at Google (again, no information past 2016 in his blog).

## Motivation
Even though the guide was written in 2015, many of the CMake scripts I have come across in my career as a pupil, freelancer, student and now research assistant are far from modern CMake. Partly because the master tutorials still explain legacy CMake (versions before 3.10) and partly because big libraries like GTK3 still haven't switched over. I will use this repository and continue to develop and maintain my CMake templates and thus keep Rico's work alive. If you have any comments or suggestions for improvement, I would be happy to receive an issue or pull request.

## Why are there so many Problemes with CMake?

Most of the problems that programmers have with CMake can be traced directly back to the developers of the library that the user wants to use. Poor documentation requiring in-depth knowledge of CMake, inconsistent naming of variable, outdated CMake scripts are common causes of frustration. The old mantras "never change a running system", "maintain backwards compatability" or simply "it works why bother" should not be used as an excuse not to update a CMake script.
